## Project Description
+ The COVID-19 vaccination system is a crucial component of the global effort to control the spread of the virus and protect individuals from severe illness or death. The process of vaccinating a large population is complex and requires coordination between multiple levels of government, healthcare providers, and other organizations.

1. The first step in the vaccination process is the distribution of vaccines to different locations. This includes the allocation of vaccines to different cities, as well as the transportation of vaccines to individual hospitals. This process is typically overseen by national and state governments, with the involvement of the World Health Organization and other international organizations.

2. Once the vaccines are in place, individuals can begin to schedule appointments to receive the vaccine. This process can involve booking appointments in-person at a vaccination site. 

3. After individuals have scheduled their appointments, they will then go to the designated  nurse to receive the vaccine. The vaccine will be administered by trained healthcare professionals, who will ensure that the individual is eligible to receive the vaccine and does not have any contraindications. Individuals will get mail after being vaccinated.

4. The final step of the vaccination process is ongoing monitoring of individuals who got vaccinated will be shown by analytic chart. 

+ In summary, the COVID-19 vaccination system is a complex and multi-faceted process that involves coordination between multiple levels of government, healthcare providers, and other organizations. The goal is to ensure that everyone who wants to be vaccinated has the opportunity to do so and to monitor the vaccine's safety and efficacy.

+ This system helps to ease in this process by providing the above functionalities in a single application
